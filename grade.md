## Comments

### HTML
- you should be removing commented out code that is not being used
- numerous input/label groups are not connected via for/id
- all pages need a unique h1

Search for `prof feedback` in individual files for specific comments.

### Bootstrap/SASS
You have Frankensteined our code from through the semester with the Bootstrap code in a way that is ineffective and causes conflict issues. You should either use full custom Sass, or Bootstrap properly. You can add some light customization on top of Bootstrap, but you should be working with the framework and not just dumping extra styles in.

- you should not be using `px` in custom code

### Responsive Design
- Numerous colour contrast errors
- technology cards become 3 columns at too small of a screen size. some of the text is being forced to wrap awkwardly
- Footer should not be `position: fixed`. Its covering most of the sign up form.

### Assignment Requirements
- not live on GH Pages
- file names should be lower case: `Portfolio.html` should be `portfolio.html`
- There should be no placeholder content or content left from other projects
- Portfolio page should have projects on it
